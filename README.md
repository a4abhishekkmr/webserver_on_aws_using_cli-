Configuring Apache webserver on AWS
you can easily get GUI guides but the real vibes of AWS using command prompt is very rare, just have a look.

The AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) is a unified tool to manage your AWS services. With just one tool to download and configure, 
you can control multiple AWS services from the command line and automate them through scripts.



AWS CLI setup: Download and installation on Windows
Download the appropriate MSI installer. Download the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (64-bit) Download the AWS CLI MSI installer for Windows (32-bit) Note. ...
Run the downloaded MSI installer.
Follow the instructions that appear.
and that's it

Now you are ready to use Aws webserver in cli

just use
aws configure
command
But it needs ID's and SEcret ID"S

For that you have to goto
Amazonaws.com>>services>>IAM>>
Now create user
Give name of user and fill some basic details then at 4th page
you will find
ID and Secret ID that will be needed to login into your AWS configure command.
and for later things refer to the pdf attached to this
or else some images are also there that will help you to directly write down the command files.
